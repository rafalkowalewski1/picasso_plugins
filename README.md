# picasso_plugins

This repository is for storing all plugins for the Picasso software, see:
https://github.com/jungmannlab/picasso

#### To create a new plugin, please see the file plugin_framework.py

Currently, the following plugins are available:
* BKM_plugin.py - adds a dialog for performing BKM PAINT, see:
* Filter_MLP_plugin.py - allows using Picasso: Nanotron models directly in Picasso: Render, which simplifies the procedure vastly
* FRET_plugin.py - for FRET DNA PAINT analysis, see: Auer, et al., Nano letters, 2017.
* Load_points_3D_plugin.py - adds an option to display points in the 3D rotation window from a .yaml file
* Ripley_H_function.py - adds an option to plot Ripley's H function from a single pick. This plugin has not been tested yet.
